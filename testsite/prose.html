        <p class="subheading">Introduction</p>
One of the most important aspects of international relations is determining the root factors that result in actions between states. This search for understanding can become easily muddled, especially when faced with the sorts of cultural and political differences that exist between China and the United States. Despite the difficulties of such analysis, it is still essential to try to understand the nature of these relations, as they form the basis of cooperation for the two most powerful countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to examine Sino-American relations during one of its most formative periods and pick out the underlying forces that shaped it. Ultimately, this paper proposes that the largest drivers of Sino-American relations from 1978 through 1989 were national economic interests. The dates of 1978 to 1989 may seem arbitrary, however the time period is encapsulated by important events in China that shaped American and Chinese policies towards each other to a greater extent than economic interests did. 

<p class="subheading">SECTION 1</p>
<p class="subheading">A Brief History of Sino-American Relations</p>
  It is impossible to gain a true understanding of the nature of Sino-American relations between 1978 and 1989 without first briefly analyzing the history between the two countries. The relationship between America and China has not been constant, nor has it always been driven by economic factors. Ideological differences, cultural revolutions, world wars, and blatant racism have all factored into the convoluted history of Sino-American relations, and it will be the role of this section to discuss these subjects and how they apply to the main topic of the paper. 
Formal Sino-American relations were established in 1844. These earliest meetings in many ways set the standard for how China and America would interact in centuries to follow. Indeed, the fact that relations began when the U.S. instigated trade with China seems to almost foreshadow the rest of this essay. However, it would be optimistic to say that these relations started well. To quote one Chinese diplomat who wrote of Americans in 1844,
“[The United States] is the most uncivilized and remote of all nations… [it] is in an isolated place outside the pale, solitary and ignorant. Not only are the people entirely unversed in the forms of edicts and laws, but if the meaning be rather deep, they would probably not even be able to comprehend. It would seem that we must make our words somewhat simple.”
While this disparaging view of Americans improved somewhat over the following century, the quote is indicative of the troubles and ideological differences that would cause friction in the beginning of relations between China and America. These differences were only exacerbated by the Open Door Notes, written by John Hay in 1999. The Open Door Policy that followed the notes was viewed as national humiliation by many Chinese and was one contributing factor to the boxer rebellion.
Following the Boxer Rebellion, Sino-American relations improved to an extent and continued to do so until 1949. It would be an exaggeration to say that relations between the countries were good during this period, yet they certainly improved from their rocky beginnings. After the failure of the Boxer Rebellion, the Chinese Government was forced to pay indemnities to foreign countries. The United States used its eleven million dollar share to increase educational and cultural sharing and to build modern infrastructure in China. During the second Sino-Japanese War, President Roosevelt sent aid to China through India to support Chiang Kai-shek. These supportive actions occurred during an era when Chinese were repressed and discriminated against in the United States. However, public sentiment was changed largely by American novelists and journalists who depicted the brutality of Japanese as well as the life of Chinese peasants.
 Though there is no official start date, it is fair to say that modern day Sino-American relations began with 136 ambassadorial meetings, which lasted from 1954 to 1970 and far preceded official United States recognition of The People’s Republic of China. However, they were fundamentally different in nature than the relations that the two countries had from 1978 onward. Factors such as Sino-Soviet relations, Cold War tensions, and Mao Zedong’s controversial and ultimately disastrous ‘Great Leap Forward’ caused too much strife for relations to be formalized between the countries (BBC News). Another factor that inhibited the development of Sino-American Relations was the United States’ support of the Republic of China. The issue of Taiwan remained a raw wound in Chinese and American relations until 1979 when the US formally recognized the PRC as the legitimate government of China (BBC News). Despite these many problems, however, during this time meetings were taking place between government officials, and this was a marked step forward from past relations. 

<p class="subheading">SECTION 2</p>
<p class="subheading">Factors Influencing Sino-American Relations Immediately Before 1978 Through 1989</p>
While it is the goal of this paper to demonstrate the leading role economic interests had in Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989, any argument presented would be at fault if it did not first analyze other factors that were instrumental to the developing relationship between China and the US during this period. Some of these subjects are academically discussed as ‘the most important element’ to Sino-American relations, and this section will ensure they receive consideration as such (Ebrey). These factors include: Sino-Russian relations, Taiwan, the wars in Korea and Vietnam, and Mao Zedong’s death followed by Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power. 
Tension between China and the Soviet Union, which formally began with Chairman Mao’s 1961 denouncement of Soviet communism, was admittedly a key factor in the development of Sino-American Relations. Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union inhibited trade between the countries almost entirely. This same inhibition exited between China and the United States in the decades following World War II. As the historian and author Mingjiang Li puts it, 
"When ideological differences exist between two countries, political leaders in one country are likely to regard the ideological and political orientation of the other country as a challenge and even a threat to their own domestic ideological and political program and goals.”
  As the ideological differences between the Soviet Union and China grew, China looked to the United States as a potential ally and began viewing the Soviet Union as their greatest threat. This all came to a head in 1968 when the Sino-Soviet border conflict began (BBC News). If it were not for this split, it seems highly probable that Sino-American relations would be fundamentally different than they are today. 
 The still-divisive topic of Taiwan was another hot point of conflict that shaped Sino-American relations before and during the 1978 to 1989 period. On October 1st, 1949, Mao Zedong finally declared victory against the Kuomintang, who retreated to Taiwan under the advice of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur (BBC). Explicit United States support for the regime of Chiang Kai-shek was, by far, the most contentious issue in pre-1979 Sino-American relations. The fact that the United States continued to officially recognize the Republic of China until 1979 curtailed most early 20th century attempts at diplomacy. The robustness of relations between the United States and the Republic of China even after formal U.S. recognition of the PRC led to military conflict and economic sanctions, which were instituted by both countries (Ebrey). However, the fact that Sino-American relations developed to the level they did by 1989 indicates that American support of Taiwan, while important, was not the driving factor in relations between the two countries during this time period. 
Two events in the mid-twentieth century that made an indelible impact on Sino-American relations were the wars in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these conflicts, the People’s Republic of China and the United States were on opposite sides. From 1950 to 1975 these wars contributed to the polarization of Sino-American relations, and the after-effects lasted even longer. The military and economic commitments China made to these wars contributed greatly to establishing a divided Korea and Vietnam, as well as defeats of United States troops in both wars. This led to the rise of the Blue Team in the United States. The Blue Team is a term used to refer to US politicians and journalists who believe that the People's Republic of China is a, if not the, most major threat to the United States national security. This informal group of Anti-Chinese politicians and writers were largely responsible for increased United States protection of Taiwan in the late 1970s (Blue Team). It is true that these conflicts created insurmountable friction between the United States and China while they were occurring. However Nixon’s de-escalation of the war in Vietnam coupled with Soviet aggression in Czechoslovakia led China to believe that the United States had lost interest in expanding influence in Asia, and that it could help check Soviet power if it became necessary. Due to this shift in Chinese perception of the United States in the late 1960s, it does not seem reasonable to suggest that the Vietnam and Korean wars were the leading factors in the development of Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989.
 Another key event that influenced Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989 was the transition of power that occurred in the Communist Party of China in 1976. Chairman Mao Zedong’s death in 1976 undoubtedly led to enormous policy changes for China. These changes had far reaching implications that greatly affected Sino-American relations for decades after the event. While informal Sino-American relations began to develop and ping-pong diplomacy and Presidential visits to China occurred during Mao’s regime, it was not until after his death that these disparate elements of diplomacy solidified into a tangible relationship (BBC News). Trade between the United States and China occurred only in paltry levels that reflected Mao’s failed Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958 (Eckstein). Admittedly, the difficulties of moving away from a planned economy were many, but the Great Leap Forward proved to be anything but in terms of American relations (Wu). The rise of Deng Xiaoping marked the beginning of drastic political and economic changes in China. Unlike the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Economic Reform instituted by Deng fostered the beginning of strong, open, and relatively equal Sino-American relations (Wu). Of all the topics discussed in Section 2, this change in Chinese political leadership holds the most sway in the developing relations of 1978-1989. However, due to the fact that most of the reforms which occurred during this change were economic in nature, it is unfair to say they were the driving factors of the time.

<p class="subheading">SECTION 3</p>
<p class="subheading">Defense of thesis</p>
Having analyzed the effects of most of the important topics in Sino-American relations between 1978 and 1989, it is possible to begin discussing why economic interests were in fact the primary drivers of Sino-American relations during this time. Discussion will focus on Chinese economic reform, the flagging yet rapidly-changing American economy of the 1970s, and the dependency that economic cooperation creates.
Chinese economic reforms, especially those that began in 1978 with Deng Xiaoping, were critical in creating a platform for Sino-American relations to build upon. There were two primary stages to the Chinese Economic Reforms instigated by Deng Xiaoping. The first of these was the de-collectivization of agriculture and a general opening up of the economy. This opening up included allowing entrepreneurs to start businesses and permitting foreign investment in Chinese industries (Wu). The second stage centered on mass privatization of enterprises that were previously government owned. There was also wide-scale deregulation of many parts of the Chinese economy and the creation of Special Economic Zones (Wu). These reforms served dual functions in bolstering Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989. 
Firstly, the reforms vitalized the Chinese economy and saved it from the downturn is was experiencing in the wake of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Secondly, by allowing foreign investment in China and by deregulating industries, competition increased, lowering prices of goods and services, and modern infrastructure in China was bolstered. These combined changes led to growth at a rate beyond anything that China had experienced in modern history. This economic development was beneficial to the government and provided stability to the country. Once this type of change was experienced, few Chinese statesmen outside of the most conservative factions of the Communist Party of China were willing to challenge the policies that led to it. Furthermore, economic pressures inside China made it difficult to consider repealing those changes in a way that was practical. It is largely due to these benefits and the lengths to which they influenced Chinese foreign relations in the following decades that this paper argues that national economic interests drove Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989. 
Across the Pacific, economic problems in the United States provided internal incentive for the formation of economic and political relations with China during the 1970’s. This benefits of this incentive increased exponentially when the United States formally recognized the People’s Republic of China and conferred upon it ‘Most Favored Nation’ status (BBC News). This change removed many United States tariffs to trading with China and promoted a free flow of resources between the countries. Due to the lack of political and ideological ties between the US and China, it is undeniable that conferment of this status was caused by potential economic benefits. By 1984, only five years after the United States’ formal recognition of the People’s Republic of China, the US had become China’s third largest trade partner. Another staggering statistic is that from 1978 to 1980, trade between the United States and China doubled yearly, from 1.1 billion USD in 1978, to 2.3 billion USD in 1979, to 4.8 billion USD in 1980 (Wang). An important note to remember is that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation. 
This change came during a time when the United States was suffering from stagflation, high rates of unemployment, energy shortages, and the outcome of bad economic policies from the 1960s. While increasing trade with China did not solve this problem, it assuaged the worst aspects of an issue that was foremost on the minds of politicians of the time. It provided a new market for investment and consumption of US goods, and it allowed for a shift in the stale economic structure of the 70s. The drive to increase and further exploit the benefits of this trade relationship wielded great influence in the United States’ international policies during the following decades.  
If there is a phrase worth coining in this essay, it is this: that ‘trade begets reliance.’ The date 1989 was chosen as one end-point of the subject of debate for this paper due to the undeniable international repercussions that resulted from the Chinese suppression of the Tiananmen protests. Yet this event perhaps only highlights the importance of economics in Sino-American relations. In the aftermath of Tiananmen, then President Bill Clinton issued an executive order that coupled humanitarian rights to China’s status as a ‘Most Favored Nation’. This change would have led to significantly decreased trade with China. However, only a year later Clinton reversed his stance largely due to pressure from American businesses (Wang). This is but one example of the reliance on Chinese trade that the United States economy developed in the 70s and 80s. Another prime example of the interdependence that developed is the level of United States investment in China. Excluding Hong Kong and Macao, the United States was the largest international investor in China, pouring three billion US dollars into China in 1985. Current Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a press conference earlier this year, "Should [The United States and China] enter into conflict or confrontation, it would lead to disaster for both countries and the world at large." While this may not have been as true from 1978 to 1989 as it is today, the statement is an accurate reflection of the degree of dependence that results from the development of strong economic relations. 
Viewed in totality, these arguments depict how the main drivers of Sino-American relations from 1978 to 1989 were national economic interests. Even weighed against the importance of the events discussed in Section 2, there can be little question of the validity of this assertion. The purpose of this essay is not to discredit the importance of factors other than economic interests in Sino-American relations, but to highlight the importance of this one topic. It is worth acknowledging that it is far from true to say that the only driver of Sino-American relations from 1978 through 1989 were national economic interests. Yet by highlighting the importance of this one topic, it becomes possible to discern a thread of continuity in these relations that has, and will in all probability continue to, shape the relationship between the United States and China. 
 
<p class="subheading">SECTION 4</p>
<p class="subheading">The importance of economic interests in current and future Sino-American Relations</p>
Since 1989 Sino-American relations have changed in some aspects, yet remained incredibly consistent in others – namely in the area of economic cooperation. In the 21st century trade between the nations expanded greatly, despite temporary setbacks and the development of contentious issues such as human rights, national security, military expansion, and the South China Sea. Of all these issues, the South China Sea is the one that receives the most attention and seems most likely to create strife between the two nations in the future. Despite the importance of conflict in the South China Sea, prominent United States Security expert, Robert Kaplan, who has written extensively about this issue, predicts that, “China is likely to become more open rather than closed as a society in future years.” This prediction is not entirely optimistic, yet it indicates the almost inevitable shift towards further international economic openness that China has been undergoing. Like a snowball rolling downhill, the more a country becomes involved in international trade relations, the more difficult it is to stop it from continuing to do so. 
Perhaps the most difficult application of Political Science is to use it to predict the future of international relations. However, given the difficulties that Sino-American trade relations have overcome, it does not seem too foolhardy to suggest that economic cooperation will continue to remain the cornerstone of political relations between the countries. This perhaps becomes increasingly evident as China buys more and more United States debt (it currently owns about 10% of it), and international corporations from both countries become more invested in each other’s markets (China US Focus). 

<p class="subheading">Conclusion
The significance of the 1978-1989 period of Sino-American relations can hardly be overstated. The ties that began to bind the two countries during this time created the framework for what may well be the most significant international relationship of the century. The cooperation between the United States and China grew in seeming inversion to the failing strength of the Soviet Union. Importantly, during this time the bilateral relationship between the most powerful countries in the world shifted during this time from being based on rampant militarism and escalation (U.S.-Soviet relations) to increased economic cooperation (Sino-American Relations). If this proves to be indicative of the style of international relations that countries will strive for in the 21st century, then the world is headed towards a period of relative peace and prosperity between large and rapidly growing international powers. 
 Analyzing the most important aspects of Sino-American relations in the past can help create a predictive model of how these relations will develop in the future. Furthermore, such analysis allows introspective study into how both the American and Chinese governments function. Finally, by understanding the key aspect to successful relations between the world’s two most powerful, and yet ideologically dissimilar, countries, it is possible to develop informed critiques of theories of international relations. These are useful tools for both students and professionals.
