      <p class="poemtitle"> Bungee Jumping </p>

<div> One year ago I was riding in a metal cart with a dish strainer bottom,</div>
<div>Holes in it through which, 6 or 7 hundred feet below,</div> 
<div>I could see the Costa Rican Rainforest River Valley. </div>

<div>We were suspended between two mountains on three thick metal cables</div>

<div>And as we winched our way towards the middle of the gulch, </div>
<div>I thought about how rare it is for people to die bungee jumping.</div>

<div>I thought about how life is short and worth living </div>
<div>And how, Hell, I wanted to do this and how…</div>
<div>How… how far below us those cows were. </div>

<div>And my palms, feet, and forehead broke out in cold sweat </div>
<div>And I heard the ‘bah boom, bah boom’ beat of blood through my body</div>

<div>Then I had a moment of clarity where I realized I was very stupid </div>
<div>And that I was fucked in the head for ever thinking this was a good idea</div>

<div>And that the cows eating and pooping peacefully in the grass below</div>
<div>Were smarter than I would ever be</div>
<div>But just then, the cart swayed to a stop and I remembered</div>

<div>My $60 were unrefundable.</div> 
<div>And besides, I knew that later I would regret quitting now</div>
<div>So too invested to turn back, I stood up.</div>

<div>The guides strapped a thin Velcro bungee around my ankles</div>
  <div>And I thought about how many yoyo strings I had broken growing up</div>

<div>And I tried to talk but my tongue just flopped around like a beached whale</div>
  <div>Because my mouth was too dry</div>

<div>Then they gave me a helmet. I looked down, imagined falling hundreds of feet,</div>
<div>And wondered what the hell a helmet would do but like religion, I put it on</div>
  <div>Just in case.</div>

<div>I walked up to an opening in the edge of the cart,</div>
<div>Curled my toes around it, and bent my knees.</div>

<div>Behind me the guides say, “On one, ready?! 5,4,3,2…”</div>
<div>And I jumped</div>

<div>Just before One.</div>


<div>Because despite the fear flooding through my body I knew</div>
  <div>That this is what I wanted</div>

<div>I plummeted through the sky as the river, trees, and cows below rushed towards me,</div>
  <div>And my entire being was in that moment.</div>
  <div>And it was euphoric. </div>

<div>----------</div>
<div>That is exactly what it felt like falling in love with you.</div>
<div>----------</div>

<div>But I am glad the metaphor doesn’t extend any farther</div>
 <div> Because unlike the bungee, the bond between you and me broke</div>

<div>See, while falling, my heart leapt in my chest but it stayed in my body</div>
  <div>Whereas you took it from me</div>

<div>And I fell out of your graces from a cloud so high that from it,</div>
  <div>I could watch the earth turn and new that it was unimportant</div>
  <div>As long as I was up there with you</div>

<div>And after falling out with you, I lay on the ground crushed</div>
  <div>With the cows eating and pooping peacefully around me</div>

<div>And I had a moment of clarity where I realized,</div>
  <div>That they were smarter than I would ever be.</div>
